Cantara is a volunteer project and therefore offers no professional support. However, the developer is very happy to help if there are any questions or troubles. The preferred way of contact would be to [open a GitHub issue](https://www.github.com/reckel-jm/cantara/issues).

GitHub is a free software collaboration platform. You can easily create an account there and then open an issue with your question or the problem which you have.
